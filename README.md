# Visualization Package with ggplot2
- Developed an R package to graphs an entire dataset with one line of code for exploratory purposes
- The package in an extension of ggplo2
- The packge contains two function:
  - scatter_plot_all(dataset, col_x = "attribute"), which creates many scatter plots with the arugment attribute on the x-axis of every generated plot and a one other attribute on the y-axis
  - hex_plot_all(dataset, col_x = "attribute"),  which creates many hex plots with the arugment attribute on the x-axis of every generated plot and a one other attribute on the y-axis
- The following plots were generated by this single line of code:

hex_plot_all(iris, col_x = "Sepal.Length", col_fill = "Species")
